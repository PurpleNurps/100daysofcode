<p id="description">A project of 100 projects to learn Python and stay committed to coding for at least an hour for 100 days. I am collaborating with Ronnie on this project to help keep us both accountable and make it a joint learning experience. We are following the course by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu1/">Angela Yu</a> - 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</p>

<h2>‚è≥ Progress:</h2>

<h3>1. Day 1</h3>

```
We learnt about the print and input functions: print("Hello, " + input("World?") + "!") 
```
<h3>1. Day 2</h3>

```
We learnt about data types and converting them to other data types. We were also introduced to f strings. Our project was to create a tip calculator.
